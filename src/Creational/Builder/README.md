## Builder
Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you build complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Problem
A company that manufactured office chairs also started to manufacture other types of chair: Gamer Chair and Ergonomic Chair. We need a system where we can know the type of chair to be manufactured and return an instance of the type of chair.

## Resolution
After an analysis, it was decided to refactor this code with the implementation of Builder.

## Prototype
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

## Problem
Let's remember the school days, when we had colleagues or ourselves who needed to hand in a school project, but we hadn't done it in advance and just before handing in the work we would make a "copy" of the colleague's work, just changing the names of who would go deliver.

## Resolution
For this we can use the Design Pattern Prototype.
